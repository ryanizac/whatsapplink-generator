# whatsapplink-generator

ðŸ”— An application that provides links for whatsapp with the following options:

- mobile
- desktop

## ðŸ¤” Motivation

First of all, this repository is initially closed, because the idea was born from a challenge for a job vacancy.

ðŸ¤© I am happy to have been given this opportunity.

But... secondly, this idea is fantastic! This allows anyone to generate links to anything.

## âš™ How it works

The difference between them is in the generated links. While the desktop version starts with **"web."**, the mobile version starts with **"api."**.

## ðŸ“± How to use

This application will be developed for a web version, made in React and transpiled to be recognized by any internet browser.
